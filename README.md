#7DaysOfCode


#1 challenge:
Rewrite a code so that it print the information correctly. 
The main objective is to learn about the difference between the operator '==' (which compares only the value from two or more variables, like the string '1' and the number 1) and the operator '===', which compares the value and the type of two or more variables.
